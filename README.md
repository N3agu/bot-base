## Summary
A robust, feature-rich Discord bot base built with `discord.py`. This includes advanced systems for ticketing, invite tracking, polling, reaction roles, and server management, all configurable via Slash Commands.

## Features

* **Ticket System**: Persistent ticket panels with Open/Close/Reopen/Delete workflows. Supports staff role configuration and chat locking.
* **Invite Tracking**: Tracks real, fake (accounts <24h old), and left invites. Logs joins and leaves with statistics.
* **Advanced Polls**:
    * **Text Polls**: Standard polls with dynamic emoji reactions.
    * **Image Polls**: Visual polls displaying images from URLs with voting buttons.
* **Welcome System**: customizable welcome messages (JSON embed support) and auto-role assignment.
* **Reaction Roles**: Auto-creates roles and assigns them via emoji reactions.
* **Theming**: Set a server-wide primary color that automatically applies to all bot embeds.
* **Embed Builder**: Parse raw JSON to send complex embeds via command.
* **Fail-Safe Architecture**: Robust error handling, logging to file, and persistent configuration.

## JSON Embeds

Commands like `/embed`, `/welcome`, and `/ticketpanel` accept a **JSON string**. You can generate these using online tools like [DiscoHook](https://discohook.com/) / [MessageStyle](https://message.style/app/editor), or you can write them manually.

**Supported Placeholders:**
* `{user}` -> Mentions the user (e.g., @N3agu).
* `{username}` -> Displays the username (e.g., N3agu).

**Example JSON Payload:**
```json
{
  "title": "Welcome to the Server!",
  "description": "Hello {user}, please read the rules.",
  "color": 3447003,
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "Get Started",
      "value": "Check out #general"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration Files
- `config.json`: Stores server settings, ticket configs, roles, and themes. Do not edit manually unless necessary; the bot handles this.
- `invites_data.json`: Stores the history of who invited whom. Used to calculate "Left" and "Fake" statistics accurately.
- `bot_errors.log`: If the bot encounters an issue, details are logged here instead of crashing the console.
